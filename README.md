**Project Title**
Django-Based Student Management System (SMS)

## 1. Description

This Student Management System (SMS) is a web application built with Django to streamline academic administration and improve the user experience for students, teachers, and administrators. It provides end-to-end support for student enrollment, document handling, payment processing, course & timetable management, attendance tracking, grade recording, assignment submission, messaging, and analytics—all within a secure, role-based environment.

## 4. How It Works

1. **Student Enrollment**

   * **Sign-Up** → fills `UserCreationForm` + profile data
   * **Document Upload** → `FileField` saves to `MEDIA_ROOT`
   * **Payment** → “Pay Enrollment Fee” button → redirects to Stripe Checkout → webhook marks `StudentProfile.is_enrolled=True`

2. **Student Experience**

   * **Dashboard** shows enrollment status, uploaded docs
   * **Grades & Attendance** modules query `Grade` and `Attendance` models filtered by `request.user.studentprofile`
   * **Assignments**: student selects pending `Assignment` instances, uploads via `SubmissionForm`
   * **Report Card**: clicks “Report Card” → view renders HTML template → WeasyPrint returns PDF

3. **Teacher Experience**

   * **Access Control**: `@user_passes_test(is_teacher)` decorator
   * **Attendance & Marks**: formsets built from `Attendance` and `Grade` querysets; teacher updates statuses in bulk
   * **Resources**: `CourseResource` model with `FileField` → uploaded files linked to a course
   * **Messaging**: `Message` model allows sender/recipient workflow
   * **Course Management**: generic class-based views (`ListView`, `CreateView`, etc.) scoped to `request.user.teacherprofile.courses`

4. **Academic Management**

   * **Timetable**: `ClassSchedule` model holds weekly slots; staff use class-based CRUD views under `staff_member_required`
   * **Attendance Linking**: optional FK from `Attendance` to `ClassSchedule` for session tracking
   * **Admin Dashboard**: staff-only view aggregates counts (`StudentProfile.count()`, etc.) and popular courses via `annotate(Count)`

5. **Navigation & Access Control**

   * Custom template filter `has_group` to show/hide nav items
   * `{% if user.is_staff %}` for admin links; `{% if user|has_group:"Teacher" %}` for teacher menus

## 5. Environment Setup

1. **Clone & Virtualenv**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourorg/django-sms.git
   cd django-sms
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configuration**

   * Copy `.env.example` → `.env` and set:

     ```
     SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
     DEBUG=True
     DB_NAME=...
     STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=...
     STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=...
     ```

4. **Database & Migrations**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

5. **Collect Static & Run**

   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. **Set Up Stripe Webhook (Dev)**

   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/payments/webhook/
   ```

7. **Access**

   * `/admin/` → Admin panel
   * `/login/`, `/logout/`, `/students/signup/`
   * `/students/dashboard/`, `/students/profile/`, etc.
   * `/students/teacher/dashboard/`, `/students/schedule/`, `/students/report-card/`

---

## 6. Future Work

* **Role Expansion**: add Parent & Alumni portals
* **Calendar Integration**: FullCalendar for interactive timetables
* **Notifications**: email/SMS reminders for due dates & classes
* **Mobile App**: React Native or Flutter front-end with DRF backend
* **Analytics**: richer dashboards with charts (Chart.js / Recharts)
* **Bulk Imports**: CSV/XLSX upload for students, timetables, grades
* **Multi-tenant Support**: isolate data per institution or department
